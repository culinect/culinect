If your application requires additional functionalities or associated data related to jobs, you might consider using subcollections. Here are a few examples:

1. **Applicants Subcollection**: If you need to store information about users who applied for a particular job, you can create a subcollection under each job document to track applicants' details such as their profiles, application status, or additional documents they've submitted.

2. **JobComments Subcollection**: Similar to comments on a post, you might want to allow users to comment on job listings. Each job document could have a subcollection to store comments related to that specific job.

3. **JobLikes Subcollection**: If users can like or bookmark job listings, a subcollection under each job document could track the users who liked or saved that job.

4. **JobReports Subcollection**: To handle reports or flags for inappropriate job postings, you could have a subcollection to store reports associated with particular job listings.

These subcollections can provide additional functionalities and help organize related data for each job. Whether you need these or other subcollections depends on the specific features and interactions you want to offer in your application.
